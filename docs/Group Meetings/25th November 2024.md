# Minutes of Meeting 1 (25/11/2024)
Meeting 1 Minutes
Key Decisions

### Project Methodology:
We have decided to follow an agile-like methodology where we meet at the start of the day, discussing blockers and set units of action, and log down our actions at the end of the day.

Our focus will be on achieving a functional first iteration aligned with the EDR created by Luke T (SSH RSS). 

#### Version Control and Project Management:
We will use a Kanban board found on the 'GitHub Projects' tab to track progress and manage work units.

#### Work Units:
We have divided this prototype into four main work units/roles, each assigned to one or more team members:
- GUI/Frontend Development
- Backend/Database Integration
- Database/Information Implementation and Structuring
- Testing, Quality Assurance and Project Management

Despite this, our project members will coordinate and work together on units, but have been assigned to the Units that best fit their strengths.

Programming Languages:
- Frontend: React.js 
- Backend: Java
- Database: PostgreSQL
    
Additional Tools:
- Gradle
- Docker
- GitHub Desktop
